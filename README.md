This repository is an application software that allows learners to understand the concepts of Stack, Queue, and Linked List in a simple and beginner's level. It has both the backend and front end design, which can be optimized as required. I have used Java programming for both the Graphical User Interface and Abstract data types implementation. 

In this repository, I have shared both the source and executable file. If you have problem downloading the files and running the .exe file, it may be due to your browser restricting to download accounting to the fact that the file comes from an unregistered author and there may be a virus threat. If so, force download while downloading and do run anyway while opening the .exe file. Else, download an IDE (Intellij IDEA of JET Brains will be ideal) and just open the source files using it and then run the files. Here's the official link for the IDE download: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.

The main program (Abstraction Implementation Kit.exe) consists of 5 different tutorial kits:

1. Abstraction Information: It consists of two tutorial tabs which give idea about abstraction and how is it implemented using Object Oriented Programming.

2. Stack: It consists of five tutorial tabs for creating a stack, adding element in a stack, removing element from stack, fetching elements in stack, and the program code and their execution.

3. Circular Queue: It consists of five tutorial tabs for creating a circular queue, adding element in a circular queue, removing element from circular queue, fetching elements in circular queue, and the program code and their execution.

4. Linear Queue: It consists of five tutorial tabs for creating a linear queue, adding element in a linear queue, removing element from linear queue, fetching elements in linear queue, and the program code and their execution.

5. Linked List: It consists of five tutorial tabs for creating a linked list, adding element in a linked list, removing element from linked list, fetching elements in linked list, and the program code and their execution.
